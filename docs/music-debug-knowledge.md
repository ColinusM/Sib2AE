# Sib2Ae Pipeline Debug Knowledge Base

*Auto-updated by sib2ae-pipeline-debugger agent - DO NOT manually edit*

---

## Project Context
**Project:** Sib2Ae Music Animation Synchronization
**Pipeline Components:** SVG Processing + Audio Processing + Synchronization
**Goal:** Accumulate SUCCESSFUL solutions for pipeline debugging

## Validation Gate Status
**Last Successful Build:** [Not yet achieved]
**Knowledge Updates Only After:** Complete pipeline success

## Debug Session Documentation (Natural Learning)

### Session Template
**Each debug session documents:**
- **Issue:** Problem description and trigger
- **Failed Approaches:** ALL attempted methods that didn't work and why
- **Working Solution:** What ultimately worked and key insights
- **Debugging Path:** Steps that led from failure to success
