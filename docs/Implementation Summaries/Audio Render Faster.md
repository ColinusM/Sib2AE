 Key Optimizations Applied:

  1. MIDI Rendering Speed-ups:
    - Parallel processing (6 workers)
    - Lower sample rate (22kHz vs 44kHz)
    - Shorter timeouts (10s vs 30s)
    - Mono audio instead of stereo
  2. Keyframes Speed-ups:
    - Parallel processing (6 workers)
    - Lower sample rate (22kHz vs 44kHz)
    - Reduced keyframe density (every 3rd frame)
    - Simplified feature analysis
    - Shorter audio duration limit (10s max)
    - Essential properties only (scale, opacity, hue, position_x)

  Output Quality:
  - Same high-quality audio files (~1MB each)
  - Streamlined keyframes (72 per file vs 1000+)
  - All essential animation properties preserved
  - Perfect After Effects compatibility
