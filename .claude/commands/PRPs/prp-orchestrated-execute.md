## Advanced Orchestration Process

### Phase 1: Orchestration Planning
```
ULTRATHINK with Orchestrator Coordination:
1. Analyze PRP complexity and determine optimal orchestration strategy
2. Deploy workflow-orchestrator for strategic planning and agent coordination
3. Assess project size and context requirements for wave-based execution
4. Design parallel processing opportunities and resource allocation
5. Plan quality assurance orchestration and validation frameworks
```

### Phase 2: Strategic Agent Deployment

#### **For Complex Multi-Component PRPs:**
```yaml
Deploy Multi-Tier Orchestration:
  Tier 1 - Strategic Coordination:
    - workflow-orchestrator: Overall project coordination and strategic planning
    - wave-execution-manager: Large-scale project phase management
    - conflict-prevention-coordinator: Resource allocation and conflict prevention

  Tier 2 - Tactical Coordination:
    - parallel-processing-coordinator: Concurrent task execution management
    - validation-orchestrator: Quality assurance and testing coordination

  Tier 3 - Domain Specialists:
    - All existing specialized agents based on PRP requirements
```

#### **For Standard Multi-Component PRPs:**
```yaml
Deploy Parallel Processing Architecture:
  Coordination Layer:
    - parallel-processing-coordinator: Concurrent development coordination
    - validation-orchestrator: Quality assurance orchestration

  Execution Layer:
    - Domain-specific agents in parallel based on PRP components
    - Independent validation agents for quality verification
```

#### **For Single-Component PRPs:**
```yaml
Deploy Enhanced Validation:
  Enhanced Execution:
    - Primary domain specialist for implementation
    - validation-orchestrator: Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
    - Independent verification agents for bias prevention
```

### Phase 3: Orchestrated Execution Strategy

#### **Wave-Based Execution (Large/Complex PRPs):**
```yaml
Wave 1 - Research & Analysis:
  Agents: All research specialists in parallel
  Coordination: wave-execution-manager
  Deliverables: Comprehensive research summary and implementation roadmap

Wave 2 - Core Architecture:
  Agents: Architecture specialists based on PRP domain
  Coordination: parallel-processing-coordinator + conflict-prevention-coordinator
  Deliverables: Foundation implementation and core infrastructure

Wave 3 - Feature Implementation:
  Agents: Feature-specific specialists in parallel
  Coordination: parallel-processing-coordinator + validation-orchestrator
  Deliverables: Complete feature implementations with testing

Wave 4 - Integration & Optimization:
  Agents: Integration and optimization specialists
  Coordination: validation-orchestrator + wave-execution-manager
  Deliverables: Fully integrated, tested, and optimized system
```

#### **Parallel Execution (Standard PRPs):**
```yaml
Phase 1 - Parallel Research:
  Research agents deployed simultaneously based on PRP requirements
  Coordination through parallel-processing-coordinator

Phase 2 - Parallel Implementation:
  Development agents working on different components concurrently
  Conflict prevention through resource allocation and staging

Phase 3 - Coordinated Integration:
  Integration agents coordinating parallel outputs
  Comprehensive validation through validation-orchestrator
```

### Phase 4: Quality Orchestration

#### **Multi-Tier Validation Framework:**
```yaml
Tier 1 - Component Validation (Parallel):
  - Syntax and style validation across all components
  - Unit testing for individual component functionality
  - Security scanning and best practice verification

Tier 2 - Integration Validation (Sequential):
  - Cross-component compatibility and integration testing
  - End-to-end workflow validation
  - Performance and scalability testing

Tier 3 - Acceptance Validation (Manual + Automated):
  - User acceptance criteria verification
  - Production readiness assessment
  - Deployment validation and monitoring setup
```

## Orchestration Command Patterns

### **Large-Scale PRP Execution:**
```bash
# Deploy wave-based orchestration for complex implementations
1. workflow-orchestrator → Strategic planning and wave design
2. wave-execution-manager → Phase 1 (Research) coordination
3. parallel-processing-coordinator → Phase 2 (Implementation) coordination  
4. validation-orchestrator → Phase 3 (Integration) quality assurance
5. conflict-prevention-coordinator → Throughout for resource management
```

### **Multi-Component PRP Execution:**
```bash
# Deploy parallel processing for concurrent development
1. parallel-processing-coordinator → Task decomposition and agent allocation
2. conflict-prevention-coordinator → Resource allocation and conflict prevention
3. Domain specialists → Concurrent implementation (3-5 agents in parallel)
4. validation-orchestrator → Comprehensive quality assurance
5. Integration specialist → Final integration and optimization
```

### **Enhanced Single-Component Execution:**
```bash
# Deploy enhanced validation for critical implementations
1. Primary domain specialist → Core implementation
2. validation-orchestrator → Multi-tier quality assurance
3. Independent verification agents → Bias prevention and cross-validation
4. Performance optimization specialist → Final optimization
```

## Orchestration Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't deploy orchestration for simple, single-file implementations
- ❌ Don't over-coordinate when sequential execution is more efficient
- ❌ Don't sacrifice quality for parallel processing speed
- ❌ Don't ignore resource contention warnings from conflict prevention
- ❌ Don't skip validation orchestration for complex implementations

## Adaptive Orchestration
The orchestration system will automatically adapt based on:
- **PRP Complexity**: Simple → Enhanced validation, Complex → Full orchestration
- **Component Count**: Single → Standard execution, Multiple → Parallel coordination
- **Context Requirements**: Standard → Direct execution, Large → Wave-based management
- **Quality Criticality**: Standard → Basic validation, Critical → Comprehensive orchestration

Execute with confidence knowing that advanced orchestration provides robust parallel processing, comprehensive quality assurance, and intelligent coordination while maintaining the highest standards of implementation quality and system reliability.
