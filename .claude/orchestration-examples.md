# Advanced Sub-Agent Orchestration Examples

This document provides practical examples of how to leverage advanced multi-agent orchestration for different types of projects and complexity levels.

## 🚀 **Example 1: Complex Multi-Component Feature Implementation**

### **Scenario**: Implementing the MIDI-SVG Synchronization System
```yaml
Project Type: Complex integration with multiple pipelines
Components: MIDI processing, MusicXML parsing, SVG coordination, After Effects integration
Complexity: High (multiple domains, cross-pipeline synchronization)
Recommended Strategy: Wave-based execution with parallel processing
```

### **Orchestration Strategy**:
```bash
# Deploy master orchestration for complex multi-component implementation
/prp-orchestrated-execute PRPs/midi-svg-synchronization-system.md

# Expected orchestration pattern:
workflow-orchestrator → Overall strategic coordination
├── wave-execution-manager → Context management across phases
├── parallel-processing-coordinator → Concurrent development coordination
├── conflict-prevention-coordinator → Resource allocation and merge safety
└── validation-orchestrator → Comprehensive quality assurance

# Wave-based execution:
Wave 1 (Research): 6 agents parallel → 15-20 minutes
Wave 2 (Architecture): 3-4 agents parallel → 20-25 minutes  
Wave 3 (Implementation): 4-5 agents parallel → 25-35 minutes
Wave 4 (Integration): 2-3 agents sequential → 15-20 minutes
```

### **Expected Benefits**:
- **Time Efficiency**: 50-70% faster than sequential execution
- **Quality Assurance**: Independent validation across all components
- **Context Preservation**: 90%+ context efficiency through wave management
- **Conflict Prevention**: Zero merge conflicts through resource coordination

## 🎯 **Best Practices for Orchestration**

### **When to Use Advanced Orchestration:**
✅ **Use Full Orchestration When:**
- Multiple components requiring parallel development
- Complex integration with cross-component dependencies
- Large-scale projects requiring context management
- Quality-critical implementations requiring comprehensive validation
- Performance-sensitive systems requiring optimization coordination

✅ **Use Parallel Processing When:**
- Multi-domain research for comprehensive PRPs
- Concurrent development across independent components
- Performance analysis requiring multiple specialized assessments
- Quality assurance requiring independent verification

✅ **Use Enhanced Validation When:**
- Critical single-component implementations
- Security-sensitive features requiring thorough assessment
- Performance-critical algorithms requiring optimization
- Production-critical features requiring deployment validation

### **When NOT to Use Advanced Orchestration:**
❌ **Avoid Orchestration For:**
- Simple single-file modifications
- Documentation-only changes
- Basic bug fixes with minimal scope
- Trivial feature additions without complexity

### **Orchestration Anti-Patterns:**
❌ **Don't:**
- Over-orchestrate simple tasks (coordination overhead > benefit)
- Deploy parallel processing without conflict prevention
- Skip validation orchestration for complex implementations
- Ignore context limits in wave-based execution
- Use orchestration without clear complexity justification

## 🚀 **Getting Started with Orchestration**

### **Step 1: Assess Project Complexity**
```bash
# Questions to determine orchestration strategy:
1. How many components/domains are involved?
2. Are there parallel development opportunities?
3. What are the quality/performance requirements?
4. Is this a research-intensive or implementation-focused task?
5. What are the context and time constraints?
```

### **Step 2: Choose Orchestration Strategy**
```bash
# Use the decision matrix above to select:
- Simple → Standard execution with enhanced validation
- Multi-component → Parallel processing coordination
- Complex → Wave-based execution with full orchestration
- Research-intensive → Parallel research coordination
```

### **Step 3: Execute with Orchestration**
```bash
# Use appropriate orchestrated command:
/prp-orchestrated-execute [PRP-file]     # For complex implementations
/prp-parallel-create [feature]           # For research-intensive PRPs
/prp-base-execute [PRP-file]              # For standard implementations
```

Advanced orchestration transforms complex, time-consuming sequential workflows into efficient, parallel, quality-assured development experiences. Use these examples as templates for your own orchestration strategies.
