# Sib2Ae Specialized Sub-Agents

This directory contains specialized sub-agents for the Sib2Ae project, optimized for parallel PRP creation and advanced technical analysis.

## Agent Overview

### Codebase Analysis Agents (Parallel Group 1)
- **`xml-pattern-analyzer`** - Analyzes XML processing patterns and MusicXML handling
- **`midi-pattern-analyzer`** - Analyzes MIDI processing, timing systems, and audio pipelines  
- **`svg-structure-analyzer`** - Analyzes SVG output structure and coordinate systems

### External Research Agents (Parallel Group 2)
- **`musicxml-spec-researcher`** - Researches MusicXML specifications and tied note standards
- **`midi-sync-researcher`** - Researches MIDI timing standards and synchronization algorithms
- **`after-effects-integration-specialist`** - Researches After Effects automation and JSON integration

### Synthesis Agent
- **`prp-architect`** - Synthesizes all findings into comprehensive, implementable PRPs

## Usage Patterns

### Parallel PRP Creation (3x Faster)
```bash
# Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (Parallel)
"@xml-pattern-analyzer @midi-pattern-analyzer @svg-structure-analyzer - analyze the Sib2Ae codebase patterns in parallel"

# Phase 2: External Research (Parallel)  
"@musicxml-spec-researcher @midi-sync-researcher @after-effects-integration-specialist - research external standards and integration methods in parallel"

# Phase 3: Synthesis (Sequential)
"@prp-architect - synthesize all research findings into a comprehensive PRP"
```

### Focused Analysis
```bash
# For XML-specific tasks
"@xml-pattern-analyzer - analyze tied note handling in the existing codebase"

# For MIDI synchronization research
"@midi-sync-researcher - find the latest standards for MIDI timing tolerance"

# For After Effects integration
"@after-effects-integration-specialist - research JSON keyframe import methods"
```

### Full Workflow Coordination
```bash
# Complete PRP creation workflow
"I need to create a PRP for [feature]. Please coordinate:
@xml-pattern-analyzer @midi-pattern-analyzer @svg-structure-analyzer - analyze codebase patterns
@musicxml-spec-researcher @midi-sync-researcher - research external standards  
@prp-architect - synthesize findings into implementation-ready PRP"
```

## Agent Specializations

### Tool Access Patterns
- **Analysis Agents**: `["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]` - File system access only
- **Research Agents**: `["WebFetch", "WebSearch"]` - Web access only  
- **Synthesis Agents**: `["Write", "Read"]` - Full file access for PRP creation

### Expertise Areas
- **XML Processing**: MusicXML parsing, tied notes, coordinate systems
- **MIDI Systems**: Timing, synchronization, audio processing
- **SVG Generation**: Vector graphics, positioning, file organization
- **Standards Research**: Official specifications, academic research
- **Integration**: After Effects automation, JSON formats, project generation
- **PRP Creation**: Technical synthesis, implementation planning, validation design

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **3x faster PRP creation** through parallel research
- **Specialized expertise** for higher quality analysis
- **Consistent methodology** across team members
- **Reusable workflows** for similar features

### Quality Enhancements
- **Domain-specific focus** for deeper technical insights
- **Authoritative research** from official sources
- **Comprehensive coverage** through coordinated analysis
- **Implementation-ready output** with validation strategies

## Version Control

These agents are committed to the project repository to ensure:
- **Team Consistency**: Same specialized workflows for all developers
- **Process Documentation**: Clear methodology for complex feature development
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Accumulated expertise in agent configurations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Iterative refinement of agent capabilities

## Best Practices

### Agent Invocation
- Use `@agent-name` for explicit invocation
- Coordinate parallel agents for independent tasks
- Use sequential synthesis for dependent analysis
- Provide clear context and specific requirements

### Task Distribution
- **Parallel**: Independent research and analysis tasks
- **Sequential**: Synthesis and validation requiring previous results
- **Batch**: Multiple related tasks with similar scope
- **Focused**: Single-domain deep analysis

### Quality Assurance
- Validate agent outputs for completeness
- Cross-reference findings between agents
- Ensure implementation readiness before synthesis
- Score PRP confidence for success prediction

This agent architecture transforms PRP creation from sequential analysis to coordinated parallel research, significantly improving both speed and quality of technical specifications.
