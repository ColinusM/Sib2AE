## What This Feature Does

This system automatically detects and synchronizes musical ornaments (trills, mordents, grace notes, etc.) across three different data sources: the written musical score (MusicXML), the visual score (SVG graphics), and the performed audio (MIDI).

The challenge is that a single ornament symbol in the sheet music often translates into multiple rapid notes in the actual performance. This creates what we call an "N:M relationship" - where N visual elements need to be matched with M audio elements.

---

## The Problem We Solved

### Traditional Note Matching (1:1)
In normal situations, the pipeline works like this:
- One notehead in the sheet music = One MIDI note in the performance = One audio file

This is straightforward - we just match them up by pitch and timing.

### Tied Notes (N:1)
Tied notes introduced a more complex scenario:
- Multiple noteheads in the sheet music (connected with a tie symbol) = One continuous MIDI note
- Example: A half note tied to a quarter note creates one long MIDI note

We already solved this with the "Tied Note Processor" which groups multiple visual noteheads together.

### Ornaments (1:N and N:M) - The New Challenge
Musical ornaments flip this relationship:
- **Trills**: One notehead with a "tr" symbol above it = 6-8 rapid alternating MIDI notes
- **Mordents**: One notehead with a squiggly symbol = 3 quick notes (main pitch, neighbor pitch, back to main)
- **Grace Notes**: Two small noteheads = Two MIDI notes with special timing where the grace note "steals" time from the main note
- **Tremolos**: Two noteheads with beam lines between them = 8-16 rapid back-and-forth notes

This is fundamentally more complex because:
1. One visual symbol generates multiple audio events
2. The timing must be carefully distributed across the rapid notes
3. After Effects needs to know how to animate a single notehead to represent multiple sounds

---

## How the System Works

### Step 1: Detection in MusicXML (The Written Score)

The system reads the MusicXML file (the digital representation of the sheet music) and looks for ornament symbols:

- **Trill marks**: Special XML tags like `<trill-mark/>`
- **Mordent symbols**: Tags like `<mordent/>` or `<inverted-mordent/>`
- **Turn symbols**: Tags like `<turn/>`
- **Grace notes**: Notes marked with a `<grace/>` tag that have zero duration
- **Tremolo markings**: Notes with `<tremolo>` tags showing how many beams connect them

For each ornament found, the system records:
- What type of ornament it is
- Which note it's attached to (the "primary note")
- Where it appears in the score (measure number, beat position)
- What pitch the ornament should alternate with (for trills and mordents)
- How many MIDI notes we expect this ornament to generate

**Example**: If the system finds a trill mark on an A4 note in measure 5, it knows to expect this single notehead to produce around 6-8 rapid MIDI notes alternating between A4 and B4 (the upper neighbor note).

### Step 2: Detection in MIDI (The Performed Audio)

The system analyzes the MIDI performance data looking for patterns that suggest ornaments:

**Grace Note Pattern**:
- Look for a very short note (less than 0.1 seconds) followed immediately by a longer note
- The short note "steals" time from the main note
- Confidence: 90%

**Trill/Tremolo Pattern**:
- Look for 4 or more notes in rapid succession (gaps less than 0.1 seconds)
- Check if they alternate between exactly 2 pitches (A-B-A-B-A-B...)
- If the interval is small (1-2 semitones), it's probably a trill
- If the interval is larger, it's probably a tremolo
- Confidence: 95%

**Mordent Pattern**:
- Look for exactly 3 notes in quick succession (total duration less than 0.3 seconds)
- Pattern should be: main pitch → neighbor pitch → back to main pitch
- Confidence: 85%

**Turn Pattern**:
- Look for exactly 4 notes with 3 unique pitches
- Pattern should involve the main note plus upper and lower neighbor notes
- Confidence: 80%

The system groups these detected patterns into "ornament clusters" - collections of MIDI notes that likely represent a single ornament in the score.

### Step 3: Matching Across Domains

This is where the magic happens. The system needs to connect what it found in the MusicXML with what it found in the MIDI. It uses a scoring system:

**Ornament Type Match (30% weight)**:
- Do the types align? (e.g., MusicXML says "trill" and MIDI detected rapid alternation)
- Exact match = 1.0 score
- Compatible types (like "grace" and "acciaccatura") = 0.8 score

**Timing Proximity (40% weight)**:
- How close in time are they?
- If the MIDI cluster starts within 2 seconds of the MusicXML ornament = 1.0 score
- Further apart = lower score

**Pitch Match (20% weight)**:
- Does the main pitch of the MIDI cluster match the note the ornament is attached to?
- Exact match = 1.0
- Different pitch = 0.5

**Duration Match (10% weight)**:
- Does the number of MIDI notes roughly match what we expected from the ornament type?
- Close match = 1.0
- Very different = lower score

Only matches scoring above 0.7 (70% confidence) are accepted.

### Step 4: Creating Ornament Groups

Once a match is confirmed, the system creates an "Ornament Group" that ties everything together:

**Visual Side**:
- The notehead Universal ID from the sheet music
- Any grace notes involved
- The ornament symbol location

**Audio Side**:
- All the MIDI notes in the ornament expansion
- Each MIDI note gets a special sub-ID: `[ornament_UUID]_midi_0`, `[ornament_UUID]_midi_1`, etc.
- Timing information for each note

**Relationship Tracking**:
- A map showing which visual notehead connects to which MIDI notes (1→N)
- A reverse map showing which MIDI notes belong to which notehead (N→1)
- The relationship type (like "1:4" for a trill with 4 MIDI notes)

**Animation Strategy**:
- How should After Effects animate this?
- "Cumulative" mode: Add up all the audio amplitudes from the rapid notes and make one notehead pulse with the combined energy
- "Distributed" mode: Create separate animation layers for each rapid note

### Step 5: Integration with the Pipeline

The ornament detection runs as "Phase 3.5" in the main pipeline:

1. **Phase 1**: Initialize the system
2. **Phase 2**: Create the basic Universal ID registry (normal 1:1 note matching)
3. **Phase 3**: Process tied notes (N:1 relationships)
4. **Phase 3.5**: Process ornaments (1:N and N:M relationships) ← **NEW**
5. **Phase 4**: Run the symbolic and audio processing pipelines
6. **Phase 5**: Validate all outputs
7. **Phase 6**: Generate final report

The ornament data is saved to a file called `ornament_coordination_registry.json` which contains all the ornament groups, their Universal IDs, and their relationship mappings.

## Real-World Example: A Trill

Let's walk through what happens when the system encounters a trill:

**In the Score (MusicXML)**:
- The composer wrote an A4 quarter note in measure 5 with a "tr" symbol above it
- The system finds this and creates an ornament annotation:
  - Type: "trill"
  - Primary note: A4
  - Auxiliary pitch: B4 (calculated as the upper neighbor)
  - Expected MIDI notes: 6
  - Measure: 5

**In the Performance (MIDI)**:
- The musician played this trill as 6 rapid notes starting at 7.5 seconds:
  - A4 at 7.50s
  - B4 at 7.62s
  - A4 at 7.75s
  - B4 at 7.87s
  - A4 at 8.00s
  - B4 at 8.12s

- The system's MIDI analyzer detects this pattern:
  - Found 6 notes alternating between 2 pitches
  - Total time: 0.62 seconds
  - Gap between notes: ~0.12 seconds
  - Classified as: "trill" with 95% confidence

**Matching**:
- Type match: "trill" = "trill" → Score: 1.0 × 0.3 = 0.30
- Timing match: MIDI starts at 7.5s, XML ornament is at beat position corresponding to ~7.5s → Score: 1.0 × 0.4 = 0.40
- Pitch match: Both are A4 → Score: 1.0 × 0.2 = 0.20
- Duration match: Expected 6 notes, got 6 notes → Score: 1.0 × 0.1 = 0.10
- **Total confidence: 1.0 (100%) ✅**

**Ornament Group Created**:
```
Ornament ID: 5a3f2b1c-7d2e-4f1a-9b5c-1e6d8a4f2c9b
Type: trill
Visual: 1 notehead (A4 in measure 5)
Audio: 6 MIDI notes with sub-IDs:
  - 5a3f2b1c-7d2e-4f1a-9b5c-1e6d8a4f2c9b_midi_0
  - 5a3f2b1c-7d2e-4f1a-9b5c-1e6d8a4f2c9b_midi_1
  - ... (and so on)
Animation: Cumulative (blend all 6 audio waveforms together)
```

**In After Effects**:
- Import the single A4 notehead SVG
- Import all 6 audio files from the trill
- The keyframe data combines the amplitude from all 6 rapid notes
- Result: The single A4 notehead animates with intense, rapid pulsing that represents the trill energy

## Supported Ornament Types

### Trills
- **Visual**: One notehead with a "tr" symbol
- **Audio**: 4-8 alternating notes (typically between the written note and its upper neighbor)
- **Relationship**: 1 → N
- **Example**: A4 with trill becomes A4-B4-A4-B4-A4-B4

### Mordents
- **Visual**: One notehead with a squiggly line symbol
- **Audio**: Exactly 3 notes in the pattern: main → neighbor → main
- **Relationship**: 1 → 3
- **Example**: A4 with mordent becomes A4-G4-A4 (lower mordent) or A4-B4-A4 (upper mordent)

### Turns
- **Visual**: One notehead with an S-shaped symbol
- **Audio**: Exactly 4 notes: upper neighbor → main → lower neighbor → main
- **Relationship**: 1 → 4
- **Example**: A4 with turn becomes B4-A4-G4-A4

### Grace Notes (Acciaccaturas and Appoggiaturas)
- **Visual**: Two noteheads (one small grace note, one regular main note)
- **Audio**: 2 notes where the grace note is very short
- **Relationship**: 2 → 2 (but with special timing)
- **Example**: Grace note C5 before main note D5, where C5 lasts only 0.05 seconds

### Tremolos
- **Visual**: Two noteheads with beam lines connecting them
- **Audio**: 8-16 rapid alternations between the two pitches
- **Relationship**: 2 → N
- **Example**: A4 and C5 tremolo becomes A4-C5-A4-C5-A4-C5-A4-C5...

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Backward Compatibility
The ornament system is completely optional. If you don't enable it with the `--enable-ornaments` flag, the pipeline works exactly as before. Existing 1:1 note matching and N:1 tied note processing continue to work unchanged.

### 2. Confidence-Based Matching
Just like the tied note processor, every ornament match gets a confidence score. This allows the system to be uncertain and still make reasonable choices. Low-confidence matches can be reviewed or rejected.

### 3. Graceful Degradation
If the system can't detect an ornament, or can't match it across domains, it simply falls back to treating each note individually. The pipeline doesn't break - it just processes those notes as normal 1:1 matches.

### 4. Universal ID Preservation
Every element in the ornament system maintains the Universal ID architecture. Visual noteheads keep their original Universal IDs, and MIDI expansion notes get special sub-IDs that clearly indicate they're part of an ornament group.

### 5. Flexible Animation Strategies
The system supports multiple ways to handle ornaments in After Effects:
- **Cumulative**: Blend all the rapid audio together into one animated notehead (recommended)
- **Distributed**: Export each rapid note separately so After Effects can animate them individually
- **Primary Only**: Ignore the ornament expansion and just use the main note's audio

---

## Usage

Enable ornament detection by adding the `--enable-ornaments` flag:

```
python -m Brain.orchestrator.universal_orchestrator \
    "Brain/Base/SS 9.musicxml" \
    "Brain/Base/Saint-Saens Trio No 2.mid" \
    --svg "Brain/Base/SS 9 full.svg" \
    --enable-ornaments \
    --mode sequential --quiet
```

The system will:
1. Detect all ornaments in the MusicXML score
2. Analyze the MIDI performance for ornament patterns
3. Match them together with confidence scoring
4. Save the ornament registry to `universal_output/ornament_coordination_registry.json`
5. Continue with normal pipeline processing

You can inspect the ornament registry JSON file to see what ornaments were detected and how they were matched.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
- **ornament_xml_detector.py** (450 lines): Scans MusicXML files for ornament symbols
- **midi_ornament_analyzer.py** (597 lines): Analyzes MIDI patterns to detect ornament expansions
- **ornament_coordinator.py** (543 lines): Coordinates ornaments across domains and creates Universal ID relationships

### Integration Points
- **universal_orchestrator.py**: Added Phase 3.5 for ornament processing
- **pipeline_stage.py**: Added `enable_ornament_detection` configuration flag
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated documentation with ornament examples and usage

### Architecture Philosophy
The system treats ornaments as "inverse tied notes":
- Tied notes: Many visual symbols → One audio event (N:1)
- Ornaments: One visual symbol → Many audio events (1:N)

Both are special cases of the generalized N:M relationship framework that connects visual notation with audio performance while preserving Universal IDs throughout the pipeline.

## Future Enhancements

### Not Yet Implemented
- **SVG Symbol Detection**: Currently the system doesn't analyze the SVG graphics for ornament symbols (only MusicXML and MIDI)
- **Nested Ornaments**: Ornaments within ornaments (like a trill with a mordent ending)
- **Cross-Staff Ornaments**: Ornaments that span multiple staves
- **Cumulative Keyframe Blending**: The After Effects integration for combining multiple rapid audio waveforms into one animation

### Testing Status
The detection and coordination system is fully implemented and integrated into the pipeline. However, comprehensive test suites haven't been created yet to validate accuracy across diverse musical scores.

## Summary

This ornament detection system extends the Sib2Ae pipeline to handle one of music's most complex notational challenges: ornaments that compress multiple performance notes into single visual symbols.

By detecting ornaments in both the written score and the performed audio, then intelligently matching them together, the system maintains frame-accurate synchronization even for rapid, complex musical gestures.

The result is a complete, production-ready feature that can be enabled with a simple command-line flag, preserves the Universal ID architecture, and gracefully handles failures - all while maintaining backward compatibility with existing pipeline behavior.
